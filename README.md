# spam-filter-1
In this series of projects I will build from the ground up a spam filter.

In this first part, I will implement a SMS filter using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

In this repository you will find the message database, `SMSSpamCollection`, and the algorithm worksheet, `bayes_algo.ipynb`.
